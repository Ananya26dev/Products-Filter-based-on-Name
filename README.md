# Products Filter based on Name

This project is an e-commerce web application built using React, React-Bootstrap, and React Router. It features a Shop page where users can browse products, search for items by name, and view product details such as name, image, and price. A search bar allows filtering of products, and each product has an icon to add it to the cart. The App component uses routing to switch between the Home and Shop pages, with a navigation bar providing easy access to both.
